- [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download) v20.12.2(LTS)
- `Text Editor`: (Visual Studio Code, Vim, etc.)

For Expo and React Native setup instructions, please refer to the official [`Expo`](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) and [`React Native`](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) documentation.

## Getting Started
